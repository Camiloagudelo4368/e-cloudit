            <p>I am so excited to finally launch Divine Blooms Bowtique.</p>
            <p>I have been a busy body these past couple of weeks working on every little detail of this project that has become very dear to me.</p>
            <p>
              I love making hair bows for my girl and was always asked to sell them but had not wanted to put my self out there like that for silly reasons. (we all deal with our own insecurities) I finally felt it was time to step out of my comfort zone and do something that I love. Please join me to be part of this  new adventure created by God.
